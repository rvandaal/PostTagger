# PostTagger

Small application to rename "POSTxxx.pdf" files (from a document scanner) to "\<company\> \<date\> \<subject\>.pdf" format. 
Using this format will ensure a convenient sorting in the Windows explorer.
Labels are in Dutch. 

Usage:
1. Start PostTagger
2. Select a POSTxxx.pdf file in the Windows explorer. It will also be displayed in the PostTagger.
3. The dropdowns (autocompletebox) in the application will be filled with similar data, retrieved from already existing files in the folder.
4. Fill in all fields and press Save. This will rename the file automatically.
